WARNING
========

this is an old expired version of the documentation.

Please use the new documentation instead. 

Here is the main page for the new documentation: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs 

And [here is the link for the newest version of the page you are currently looking at](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master//attacks_analyzed/unclosable_channels.md)

one way a channel contract can fail is if the nonce is always increasing with height.
This means the attacker can publish slash transactions over and over to keep the channel open as long as they want.
