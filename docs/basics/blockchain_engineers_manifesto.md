A Blockchain Engineer's Manifesto
===========

Blockchain development is slow today because the process of trial and error is expensive and slow.
Testing out a single idea involves launching a new cryptocurrency, and can cost millions of dollars.

We should develop mathematical tools which will allow us to calculate whether one kind of blockchain design is more secure than another.

Examples:
* https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/basics/trust_theory.md
* https://vitalik.ca/files/intro_cryptoeconomics.pdf

Once we have math tools like this, it will make it a lot easier to do blockchain engineering, because we can check if a strategy can possibly work without having to actually launch a blockchain.

These math tools are still a work in progress. Please don't take their results too seriously yet.

My strategy to develop these math tools is like this:
1) think really hard and come up with the best tools I can. Start with some model that can be improved iteratively.
2) Write up some reports about which blockchain projects would be considered insecure according to the math tools currently being considered.
3) Carefully read the responses from people who are upset that I called their blockchain insecure.
4) revise the mathematical security framework based on what we have learned, then go to step (2).


Here are some example reports that I have done as a part of step (2):
