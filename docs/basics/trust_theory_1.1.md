Trust Theory 1.1
==========

Security level 1.1 is the most powerful kind of security available, so it is good to find out what kinds of financial contracts can happen in 1.1
1.1 is also the least expensive level of security. Apps that can have level 1.1 are cheaper and will outcompete the competition by undercutting their price.

Level 1.1 is the world of purely cryptographic mechanisms.
Economic mechanisms cannot achieve level 1.1, because economic mechanisms assume that the actors are motivated by profit.

Determinisitic computations that can be run in a short time are in security level 1.1
Example 1.1 level mechanisms: bitcoin scripts, encryption algorithms, hash algorithms, cryptographic signature algorithms, the trustless coinflip protocol.

Examples of mechanisms that cannot be written in 1.1: currency, oracles.
