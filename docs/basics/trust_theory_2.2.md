Trust Theory 2.2
==========

[trust theory basics](trust_theory.md)

Security level 2.2 is the level of security used in the Bitcoin blockchain. It is not as secure or cheap as 1.1, but it is much easier to use.

Security level 2.2 is the highest level of security that can be targetted using cryptoeconomic mechanisms. It is also the least expensive level of security that can be used with cryptoeconomic mechanisms.
This means that if a cryptoeconomic mechanism can be written to level 2.2, that the level 2.2 version will out-compete all other versions because of undercutting the price.

If Amoveo's oracle works, then it is possible to have an oracle in 2.2, which means mechanisms in 2.2 can have access to any public data.

That means in 2.2 we can make contracts between pairs of people such that the amount of money that each party gets depends on the output of the results of arbitrary events fed into an arbitrary deterministic program.

Hashtimelocks are a tool in 2.2 that allow us to connect contracts together, so the states of the different contracts update atomically. This means that any app that can be written for pairs of people can also be written for groups of people with more than 2 members.

So it is always possible to use 2.2 to write arbitrarily precise versions of mechanisms as long as it is possible to decompose that mechanism into some turing complete piece of software, and facts from the oracle.

Epistemologically speaking, everything we can know is a combination of what we can calculate, and what we can look up. People are only interested in having financial apps who's outcome is related to information we can know.

therefore:
any financial application that people would be interested in using can be written at security level 2.2


corollary:
Since level 2.2 is both cheaper and more secure than any other level, any financial app that is not written to security level 2.2 will inevitably fail to competition that is at level 2.2.
