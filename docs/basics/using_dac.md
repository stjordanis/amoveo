Using DAC
========

Lets say Bob wants to be paid to write a book.
Then Bob should make a bet that the book will get written, so that if he writes the book, he profits.

Usually, Bob puts less money in the contract than his customers. The money Bob could lose is only supposed to compensate for a small interest rate, for the amount of time that the money was inaccessible to his customers.
