People on social media have been making fake accounts impersonating Amoveo team members.
Be very careful.

A typical scam goes like this:
The scammer makes a fake account pretending to be a core Amoveo team member.
They promise to pay back 2 veo for every 1 veo you send them.
They just keep your veo, do not send 2 back.
