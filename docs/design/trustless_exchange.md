Trustless exchange
=========

An exchange is a service that lets you swap one kind of cryptocurrency for another. For example, you can trade BTC for VEO.

Exchanges today are all insecure.
The centralized ones can steal your money by refusing to let you withdraw.
The decentralized ones can steal your money by front running you, or using free options.

Amoveo makes it possible to build a truly trustless exchange.
This is an exchange that is completely secure against theft.

The trick is to divide the process of the exchange into 2 steps.
1) transform your VEO into stable BTC on Amoveo.
2) do an atomic swap to trade your stable BTC on Amoveo for BTC on Bitcoin.

step 1 is already live on Amoveo.

step 2 works because stable BTC and BTC have a fixed ratio of prices relative to each other. So it isn't possible to front run the trade, because there is exactly 1 price that the trade can happen at.



The stable bitcoin on Amoveo can be set up so their oracle finishes in 1 or 2 days.
So you are trading BTC on Bitcoin for the price of BTC in tomorrow's worth of VEO on Amoveo.
