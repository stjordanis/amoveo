Trustless Withdraws
========

When we say that Amoveo has "trustless withdraws", what we mean is that it is impossible for anyone to prevent you to get your winnings out under any conditions.

In many betting markets today, if you win too much or if the website suspects cheating, then they can make it extra difficult for you to get your money out.

In Amoveo this cannot happen. The smart contracts are executed automatically based on the code. No person can prevent you from earning the money that the smart contract says you should have earned.
