Cryptoeconomics is seen today as a mysterious field of study, only understood by geniuses.

What makes cryptoeconomics so difficult? The math is fairly simple.
The problem is that people's concept of money is intertwined with their political and religious beliefs.

If you can let go of your preconceptions, and just look at the results of the math, you will find that crypto-economics is easy.


Here are some uncomfortable facts you need to deal with if you want to understand cryptoeconomcs:

* Life is not fair. There is no karma.
* How you wish money works does not matter. Even if we all wish for something at the same time, it will not change reality. 
* We cannot wish value into existence, not even if we all wish at the same time.
* Survival is not free. If you cannot produce or steal value, then you will die.
* The outcome of voting is determined by whoever is willing to invest the most money into manipulating the outcome.
* People always act in self-interest. Even people who tell themselves stories about acting for a "greater good".


Once you have let go of your political inhibitions, then cryptoeconomics is merely the application of some simple math tools.

* supply/demand curves
* nash equilibriums
* public/private key cryptosystems
* one-way functions
