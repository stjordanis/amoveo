WARNING
========

this is an old expired version of the documentation.

Please use the new documentation instead. 

Here is the main page for the new documentation: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs 

And [here is the link for the newest version of the page you are currently looking at](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo-docs/blob/master//getting-started/erlang_install.md)

First, make sure you have erlang installed. Version 18 is prefered, but older versions will probably work. Ubuntu makes erlang available in the package manager
```
sudo apt-get install erlang
```

Here is how to install erlang from source:
download: https://www.erlang.org/download.html
install instructions: https://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL.html
