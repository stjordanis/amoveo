Mining Pool Survival
=======



It is important for the security of Amoveo that no individual mining pool should have more than 50% of the hashrate. If they do, then they could rewrite history to steal Veo from us all.

This page lists strategies we have found to make mining pools stronger in the face of denial-of-service attacs.

* make a white list of who can contact your full node. Only accept connections from other full nodes.
