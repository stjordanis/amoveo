Reporting Bugs
=====

Learning how to report bugs is probably the most effective thing an early adopter of new technology can do to help the project succeed.
Reporting Bugs can be intimidating.
It is not obvious what information is important for the developer, and should be included in the report.
This guide is designed to simplify the process, so that making bug reports is fast, easy, and enjoyable.

A good bug report often includes these parts:
1) tell a story of your intended interaction with the software.
* what is the intended goal of using the software?
* a timeline of commands you type, or buttons you press.
2) explain how the output of the program differed from your expectations.
3) include all outputs from the program that differ from your expectations, and a little more for context.
