Scalar Bet
=========

A scalar bet is where the money in the contract gets divided between the two participants based upon a 10-bit value measured by the oracle.
A scalar oracle can return any number between 0 and 1023.

With a scalar bet, the money gets split up based upon what number is returned by the oracle.

For scalar bets, you need to use a scalar oracle. binary oracles will not work.
