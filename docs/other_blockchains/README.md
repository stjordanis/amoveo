### Other Blockchains


This is where I talk about strengths and weaknesses of other blockchain projects besides Amoveo.

Looking at other projects can help make it clear why Amoveo is designed the way it is.

Sometimes other projects pay me to do a review of them, because this helps them know how to improve.

Each document has a date on it.
The information will expire very quickly.
These projects are still in progress, they are constantly changing.
