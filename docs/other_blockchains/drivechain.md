Drivechain Review
=====
Draft # 6

Drivechain is a project with the goal of allowing for multiple different blockchains to be secured by the PoW consensus on a single blockchain. It is a goal of drivechain that bitcoin miners should not be required to think about or involve themselves with the side-chains.

Abstract
=======

The goal of this paper is to that it is not possible to use drivechain as it is currently designed to secure any sort of side-chain consensus state. It will always be cheap for an attacker to harass the users of a side-chain to the point where the side-chain is unusable. The PoW security from bitcoin is not properly securing the side-chain.

The critique in this paper has not been responded to before
===========

The critique I am making here is neither (1) nor (2) from this paper: http://www.drivechain.info/peer-review/peer-review-new/

* I am not describing a way for the miner to steal sidechain funds.
* I am not describing a way that this could cause pool overhead or txn-censorship.

In this paper http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/ in the section "Problem", Paul describes how an attacker could spam invalid block data to prevent a side:chain from progressing, and why this is not a security issue, because the main chain miners could temporarily upgrade to be side chain full nodes to know which version is valid.

This problem is different from the critique I am making in this paper. The "Problem" Paul fixed is how to prevent side:chain hard update. The problem I am describing is somewhat related. In my critique, the attacker is making a side:soft update.

Paul's solution to merely upgrading miners to side:full-node status works great for preventing side:hard updates, but it does not solve the soft-fork problem, because both side of the soft-fork look valid to a side:full-node.

Mistakes in the math describing this mechanism
============

In this document http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/drivechain/
In the section "Some Math (ie, Feel Free to Skip)"

Paul does some math to calculate the cost to miners if they censor sidechain block data, to try and show that drivechain does work. The math in this section is based on some misconceptions.

* After a soft fork has been merged, then the txs that are invalid according to the new ruleset are as invalid as any other invalid tx. Pretending like it is possible to receive tx fees from txs that are invalid because of a soft fork, that is like pretending it is possible to make a tx that creates 10k BTC from nowhere, and pays the miner a 9k BTC fee to let it happen. Invalid txs cannot be included no matter how high the fee is. This principle holds true for soft forks that happen on a sidechain as well.

* It isn't an all-or-nothing situation for censoring side:txs. For example, we could enforce a high tx fee that gets paid to the bitcoin miners, censoring all side:txs that don't pay up. This would be a compromise between completely stealing the side-chain value, vs supporting it's existence. Depending on the Laffer curve, and the existence of competition for this side-chain, this side:soft-fork could increase miner revenue. In any case, the value destroyed will be much bigger than the bribes you need to pay to miners to make it happen.

* The "total miner losses" value calculated in { 2b }, this is a distributed cost spread out among all the miners. If I only have 1/10th of the hashpower, then I will only feel 1/10th of the total damage, and I will only cause an increase in damage proportional to my hashpower.
Overall, my cost to participate is TML * ((my hashpower)/(total hashpower))^2. This is a tragedy of the commons situation. Individual benefit and collective losses, but Paul later applies the result of this calculation as if it was individual benefit and individual losses. 

Description of the broken mechanism
============

The part of drivechain that does not work is the blind merged mining.
Here it is described by Paul: http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/blind-merged-mining/

I will describe it in my own words:

In order for a side:block to be valid, it's hash needs to be recorded into a main:block.
So sidechain block creators need to pay the mainchain miner to include this hash in their block.
Since anyone can create the side:block, the side:block creator needs to give practically all of the fees from that side:block as a bribe to the mainchain miner.

In the "handling reorganizations" section, Paul explains about the fork choice rule for the side chain. The version of the side:chain fork that gets more confirmation hashes recorded onto the main:chain wins.

This means that the side of a side:chain fork that gets more confirmations is the valid version of history.

Any fees the side-chain block creators had paid to let their side-blocks get created, they do not get a refund if their side:block is orphaned.
If the side:block is orphaned, they do not receive any tx fees.

So it is very expensive for the sidechain block creator if their block gets orphaned.

Why it is cheap to cause side-blocks to get orphaned
===================

Mainchain miners don't care if the side:block they are validating will get orphaned or not. They will get paid the fees either way.

If the mainchain miners frequently allow side:blocks to get orphaned, this can indirectly harm them because it makes the entire network worse. But, this cost to the mainchain miner is on the order of (percentage of hashpower they have.) As the hashpower gets more distributed, they are more and more willing to allow side:blocks to get orphaned.

As long as the side-block that will cause the orphaning to occur is paying a higher fee than the cost to the miner of orphaning the previous side:block, then the miner is willing to verify it.

Even though the benefit to the miner of doing this is far smaller than the cost to the network of the side block getting orphaned. It is tragedy of the commons.


Double-Spend Attacks. Finality issues.
=======

side-chain orphans are different from main-chain orphans, because the side-chain blocks are paid for in liquid currency, while main-chain blocks are paid for in illiquid hashpower.

First describing main:chain mining. If you try to buy up 51% of hashpower, it keeps getting more expensive the more you buy. 
If you have 2x more hashpower than the entire network, you can still only rewrite 1 hour per hour.
So if you had 2x more hashpower for a period of 10 hours, you could rewrite 10 hours of pow history. So to rewrite 10 hours of history, you need to spend as much as 20 hours of (block rewards).

With proof-of-burn, and with drive-chain side-chains, you only need to be willing to accept a slightly smaller reward for creating 10 hours of blocks in comparison to whoever created them the previous time.

undoing side-chain blocks in drivechain is akin to undoing blocks in a proof-of-burn blockchain. Anyone who is willing to accept a smaller reward for side-block creation can rewrite those side-blocks.

This means drive-chain sidechains will have very slow finality, it is not clear if a tx can ever truly be finalized.


Freeze Attacks
=======

If you want to cause a delay in a drivechain sidechain, you just need to be willing to receive a slightly smaller reward than whoever had created the blocks in that history the previous time.

Since it is cheap to cause the sidechain to stop processing txs, and an attacker could profit from freezing a sidechain by making bets in other markets, this means drivechain sidechains are trust level 4. https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/basics/trust_theory.md

If you want to cause a delay in bitcoin, you need to pay more than the cost of (all the fees) + (all the block rewards) for the period in question, and the price of fees will keep getting higher, because the scarcity will drive demand. So you are paying ((block reward) + ((extra high fee price) * (as many tx as can fit in a block))) * (number of blocks during the attack period).

Sidechain block creation griefing
===========

If someone spends $99 to earn $100 and create a block, and I spend $101 to earn $100 and create the same block to cause their block to get orphaned, then that means I lost only $1, but I caused someone else to lose $100.
Since it is possible to destroy more of someone else's value in comparison to the cost of the attack, that means that Drivechain sidechains are trust level 3 or worse. https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/basics/trust_theory.md


Bitcoin without block rewards
==========

Paul says that a basic assumption of his design for drivechain, is that drivechain can only work if it is possible that bitcoin can be secure with no block rewards.

Paul from Drivechain Telegram- "one of my arguments for drivechain is that we can use it to learn about the behavior of blockchains that lack a block reward."

It seems like Bitcoin will indeed be able to function without block rewards https://twitter.com/fnietom/status/1037235118136602625?s=20

Drivechain is using a different and less secure consensus mechanism than bitcoin without block rewards
==================

In the current design of drivechain, the sidechains are actually very different from how bitcoin would be if it had no block rewards.

In bitcoin with no block rewards, if a block is orphaned, the miner does not get paid. The miner takes a loss in the form of hashes. Hashes are a illiquid type of value. If an attacker accumulates Hashpower to attack, this means he needs 51% of the global hashpower, which is very expensive.

In drivechain, if a side:block is orphaned, the miner does get paid, and a side:block creator, who is a different person from the miner, he takes a loss in the form of currency. Currency is a liquid type of value. If an attacker accumulates currency to attack, he only needs to spend as much as all the fees during the period of the attack. This is relatively cheap.

This difference in the kind of cost for causing orphans means that conclusions made about the security of one of these systems can not necessarily be applied to the other.


Can we fix it by splitting up the block reward, and having part of it created inside the side-chain?
============================

If side:block creators received a block reward for creating the block, practically 100% would have to go to the main:miner who includes that hash of the block, for the same economic reasoning as why the fees go the main:miner.
If the block gets orphaned, the block reward is actually making it more expensive for the side:creator than it would have been otherwise. Now the side:creator isn't just losing the fees, they are losing the block reward as well.
So this doesn't work.

Can we fix it by splitting up the block reward on the main-chain?
===============

Imagine if in the main-chain, the block reward is higher for any main:blocks that validate a side:block.
The problem is that main:miners still don't have an incentive to avoid causing side:orphans.


Can we fix it by canceling payments to the main:miner if the side:block is orphaned?
============
We can either use the prevSideBlock reference numbers to calculate which blocks were orphaned, or we can add more data to the BMMR.

In this case, the sidechain would be equivalent to bitcoin without block rewards.

1) This solves the problem where it was cheap to cause an orphan and harm a side:block creator.
2) This solves the finality issues, because an attacker would have to re-mine all those block rewards.
3) This solves the freezing issues, because now if you want to cause a delay this way, you have to pay for all the side:rewards during the delay.
