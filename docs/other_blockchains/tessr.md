Tessr
========

Tessr is a project to use blockchain technology for educational reasons.

Wired gave a report about the death of one of Tessr's devs https://www.wired.com/story/strange-life-mysterious-death-of-virtuoso-coder/

During July 2018 the Tessr project did an ICO to sell TSRX tokens for $0.09 each https://icorating.com/ico/tessr-tsrx/#team

You can see google wayback machine has a copy of their website. It was 5000 TSRX tokens for 1 ETH. https://web.archive.org/web/20180802031037/http://www.tessr.io/

Here you can see the smart contract for the TSRX ERC20 token https://etherscan.io/token/0x8c5227134c834815d0dfa5c6d66d9aaa281aeae0 You can see the total number of tokens is 400 million.

Here you can see that the total number of tokens that exist after pre-ICO and ICO is 700 million https://icorating.com/ico/tessr-tsrx/
And you can see that 70% of the total TSRX tokens were sold in the pre-ICO or ICO.

I can't find any clear explanation of how much money TSRX raised in the ICO, but given all the information available, I think we can safely assume that they raised more than $20 million.

Shortly after raising the money, all work on Tessr was halted. The team abandoned the project entirely.
I can't find any evidence that Tessr gave a refund of the $20 million, it appears that the Tessr team ran off with the money without even attempting to deliver on the product they had promised.

Emanuel Sylvia
=========

Infrastructure lead for Tessr.

He founded Tessr. He quit his job at JPMorgan Chase to start working on Tessr 6 months before anyone else got involved with Tessr.

Emanuel is the only person who wrote any blockchain code for Tessr, as you can see on his github https://github.com/tessr8/blockchain/commits/master

Emanuel is the only person who wrote any smart contract code for Tessr, as you can see from his other repository https://github.com/tessr8/Solidity/commits/master

2 months after raising millions in ICO, Emanuel's private email with Jerold Haas' mom reveals that the Tessr project has been abandoned.


Jerold Haas
========

He was listed as the development lead for Tessr.

Jerold Haas was a mentally ill drug addict who died around August 30 2018.

You can see on his github that Jerold was a hobbiest programmer in 2015 and 2016. https://github.com/jeroldhaas

Jerold wrote almost exclusively in F#. Occasionally he would use C#, and on one occasion he used javascript.
It is clear he didn't take programming seriously, he often went months at a time without writing any code at all, and he basically stopped programming in 2016.

According to this article https://www.wired.com/story/strange-life-mysterious-death-of-virtuoso-coder/ Emanual Sylvia described Jerold this way:

“The programming language we use to write smart contracts, Solidity? Jerold picked it up in a day or two,” Sylvia says. “I've been in this industry for 20-some years and met a lot of brilliant people, and Jerold was one of the best. He definitely had this extreme talent.”

Sylvia also says that Jerold had written lots of blockchain and smart contract software, but it was all encrypted inside of Jerold's laptop.
When Jerold died, they lost all their work.

Sylvia is using Jerold's death as an excuse to abandon working on Tessr.



What work did Jerold do?
=================

Jerold made around 5 contributions to Tessr. They were all very minor details. It is hard to consider any of these contributions as "programming", they are more like tasks someone would do while they are learning how to program. I will link to all 5 here:

1) Jerold created this README file with the 2 lines of text "# blockchain" and "Blockchain Projects" https://github.com/tessr-labs/Solidity/commit/898442ee6923dddd395513a75fa29da910e3d3c6

2) Jerold fixed a spelling error related to an ampersand symbold `&` https://github.com/tessr-labs/web/commit/9cd6fe95eff5c5e1c5ef7421eda3025c426f73d7

3) Jerold committed this auto-generated .gitignore file which is built for CakePHP development with github. https://github.com/tessr-labs/web/commit/6a1389f490858bb82a80fb8b51c2053803afd2da

4) Jerold explained the branding of Tessr/TSRX/etc https://github.com/tessr-labs/branding/commit/2597e06f133cad2473c003a47dfe1f240bfe810e

5) Jerold fixed a spelling error https://github.com/tessr-labs/branding/commit/3504eee50a6c77ed671f4927bb17934ae044e895

Jerold did not write any software related to blockchains or smart contracts.

I estimate it would take an average programmer around 1 or 2 hours to finish all 5 tasks which make up the totality of everything Jerold accomplished for Tessr. 


Jerold's compensation
===========

In exchange for his work for Tessr, Jerold was promised that he would eventually get 1.5 million of the TSRX tokens, according to this https://www.wired.com/story/strange-life-mysterious-death-of-virtuoso-coder/

1.5 million TSRX is worth around $135,000. It is either 0.375% or 0.214% of the total TSRX, depending on whether there are 400 million or 700 million total tokens.

According to this page, 12% of the total market cap of TSRX is supposed to be dedicated to building the software. https://icorating.com/ico/tessr-tsrx/

So that means that Jerold's work is worth less than 3% of the total expected cost of building the software.

So, there was an expectation that 97% of the software was going to come from people other than Jerold.


Why was work on Tessr abandoned?
===========

Emanuel Sylvia says that they had to abandon Tessr because the loss of Jerold's work was too much for them to recover from.

This seems like a lie for several reasons:

* If Jerold's work was really so important, why was he only being paid 3% of the software budget?

* If Jerold's work was so important to Tessr, how come Emanuel was working on Tessr for 5 months before Jerold became involved? How could a poor Emanuel work for 5 months without Jerold's help, but an Emanuel with $20 million is unable to continue without Jerold's help?

* if Jerold's work is so important, how come there is no evidence on github of him doing any work for Tessr? What was Jerold doing for Tessr from Febuary until July? Why did they employ him for 6 months?

* Since the ICO ended 1 month before Jerold's death, almost none of the ICO money was consumed in creating Jerold's software. So practically 100% of the ICO money was still available to build Tessr.

* The idea that a software developer in the blockchain space wouldn't publish all their work as open source immediately after writing it, this is absolutely unbelievable. No blockchain software developer would do that to themselves. Trying to write cryptoeconomic software without being able to talk about your work to the rest of the cryptocurrency community is so much more difficult. 

* The idea that a team would do an ICO without making their software open source first is a rediculous fantasy. It is critical to make the code open source before they try to raise money. It is far easier to raise money if there is some evidence that work is actually being done. That way investors can know that you are serious about delivering a working product.

* The idea that a team would employ a software developer who refuses to share the software that they are writing is rediculous. If the Tessr team can't see the software being written, how can we know that any software is being written at all? There are no software jobs where they pay you to write secret software on your computer and never share it.


Charles Ford
==========

Charles Ford is the husband of Deb Ford, who is one of the 6 people on the board of advisors for Tessr.

6% of all TSRX tokens were reserved for advisors, so it seems like Charles and Deb must have received 1% of all TSRX tokens. This means they are paid around 4 fold more than Jerold. So Charles and Deb must have created at least 4 fold more value for Tessr in comparison to Jerold.

Before working on Tessr, Jerold was a homeless drug addict living on Charles Ford's couch.

Charles Ford is the last person who saw Jerold alive. He was driving Jerold on an unplanned trip through a remote location Jerold had never been to before. Charles claims that Jerold ran away without warning.

Etienne Fieri
==========

Etienne was working on Tessr before Jerold got involved. Her title was "business team".

Charles Ford, the husband of a Tessr board member, emailed Etienne a resume for Haas.

It was Etienne who interviewed Jerold to bring him onto the Tessr team.
Upon interviewing Jerold, an unemployed homeless drug-addict, Etienne almost immediately fell in love with him.

Jerold finally stopped sleeping on Charles' couch, and instead moved into Etienne's place.

When Jerold died, Etienne Fieri got all his money that he had been paid from Tessr.
She had access to his bank account.

Etienne claims that she and Jerold were planning on getting married.

Etienne claims that she and Jerold started dating in the winter. 


A motive to kill Jerold
==========

Building a blockchain is expensive.
The Tessr team had at least $20 million.
So they have a motive to find a way to just keep the money for themselves, and not spend the money building an expensive blockchain.

So they had a motive to find an excuse to not build Tessr.

By killing off a drug addict that no one cares about, and then pretending like he was a critical part of building Tessr, this would allow the Tessr team to keep the $20 million for themselves, and they don't have to spend it building a blockchain.
