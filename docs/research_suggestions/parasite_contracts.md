Parasite Contracts
=========

Imagine a smart contract on Amoveo that could watch a channel on Bitcoin Hivemind, and enforce the rules of nonces on the bitcoin hivemind channel without actually updating the nonce on the bitcoin hivemind side.

It would involve writing a chalang contract to be small bitcoin hivemind light node to verify some headers, and a merkel proof of the channel's final state from hivemind.

This tool would allow people to use bitcoin hivemind channels with real bitcoin to make bets on the outcome of the bitcoin hivemind oracle, without paying any trading fees.
It would be a parasite contract, and it would change the nash equilibrium so that bitcoin hivemind would stop being secure. The reporters would have an incentive to make the outcome of an oracle a lie so they can steal all the money from the market.

So it would be a cool hack that can cause a competing oracle blockchain to fail, but since the reporters are the ones doing the stealing, it is all their fault.
You aren't committing any crime by writing this hack, or by using this hack to gamble for free. The hivemind reporters are the ones who stole money.
I imagine a future where blockchains try to create economic exploits to syphon value from each other.

If people spend fees on Amoveo to earn money from another blockchain, this is good for Amoveo.

This is why it was important that our oracle isn't just secure when you look at our blockchain in isolation.
Unlike many of our competitors, Amoveo's oracle is secure against parasite contracts on competing blockchains.
The standard way of betting in Amoveo is to not pay any fee to the oracle reporters. So a standard Amoveo bet is already equivalent to what would be a parasite contract in Bitcoin Hivemind or Augur.

So if someone built a generalized parasite contract that worked against any oracle blockchain, that would not harm Amoveo at all. It would be a boost to the scalability of our network, acting as a sort of side-chain to Amoveo.

The generalized parasite contract would destroy Augur and Bitcoin Hivemind, because without the trading fees being paid to oracle reporters, their oracles break.
