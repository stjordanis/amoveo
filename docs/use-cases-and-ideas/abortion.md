Abortion
======

A lot of people are upset about bad abortion laws.

This is an opportunity for you to realize the big picture. The bad abortion laws are just one symptom of a much bigger problem. If you want to solve the problem of bad abortion laws, you need to focus on the real cause of the problem, not superficial symptoms.

Think about the differences between the motivations of the people who support bad abortion laws, and the reasoning that they use when arguing for these laws.
Their reasons when arguing is about protecting children.

But protecting children is not profitable. There will almost never be propagandists who's actual goal is to protect children, because that propaganda company would quickly run out of money. Propaganda is a business. In business, only the profitable survive.

The propagandists aren't trying to directly trick us into thinking that their goals will protect children, the sociology of their manipulation goes deeper. By framing their goal as the protection of children, it becomes socially unacceptable to oppose the propagandists. Because opposition of the propagandists is seen as the same as opposition to the safety of children.
This makes rational discourse about the topic taboo. So polite society stops talking about it, which makes it harder to get any good information on the topic, and it makes it harder to know what anyone else is thinking about the topic. It creates an environment of ignorance, which is exactly the conditions the propagandists are trying to achieve, it gives them maximum control.
The propaganda machine works to destroy the credibility of everyone who breaks their taboos.

So every time someone says "the government needs to do X to protect children", this is a lie to trick us into supporting something that is probably not in our best interest.


Propagandists will exist and cause these problems for as long as it is profitable for them to do so.
Propaganda will be profitable as long as society makes decisions by voting or representation.
Putting a dictator or king or manager in charge doesn't solve this either, the problem just switches from propaganda to lobbying.

The solution is that we should use futarchy to make our decisions instead of voting or representation or putting a manager in charge.

If we use futarchy to make our decisions, then there is no one who you can propagandize or lobby to have any control over how the decisions are made. There is no way for a rich person to use their wealth to have any control over the decisions being made.

Futarchy is illegal almost everywhere, (to protect the children!)
So we at Amoveo are building it onto a blockchain, that way we can use futarchy and no one can stop us.
