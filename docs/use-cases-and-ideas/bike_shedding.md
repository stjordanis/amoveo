Bike Shedding
========

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality

Bike shedding, also known as the Law of Triviality, is the problem that communities making decisions tend to spend their time and energy on the more trivial, more easy to understand parts, and less energy elsewhere.

Moral Narratives are Independent from Policy
=========

The literal implementation of a public policy, and the narrative used to explain and justify that policy, these are almost completely mutually exclusive.
Any public policy can be explained using a narrative based in any ethical code.

China is creating more free trade and private property in their economy, but they always wrap it up in a pro-communism moral narrative.
USA is making broad moves restricting the freedom of trade, but they always wrap it up in a pro-capitalism moral narrative.

In the USSR, there was a time when physicists were blocked from publishing any research, unless they could explain their results within the moral narrative of Dialectical Materialism, which was a sort of athiest-religion that was popular at that time.
Even though the results of physics are totally amoral, the physicists were always able to cook up some wacky story about how the universe itself was supporting the morals of our great nation.
This is because the moral narrative that they use to explain the discoveries is independent of their content.

The moral narrative used to explain why a policy exists is completely independent of that policy.
So, if your "debate" is only arguing about the relative moral narratives of two policies, then you are only debating aesthetic aspects of the policy. You might as well be debating what to name it.

Modern politics is completely swamped by this problem. Decisions are made based on minor aesthetic details.
It is a battlefield in the war of moral narratives, and many innocent people are getting caught in the crossfire.

The Hypocrisy of Modern Politics
=========

The hypocrisy can be overwhelming, lets take the abortion debate in USA in 2019 for example.

* The red team is dedicated to their moral narrative about life being sacred, and killing a human being murder.
* The blue team is dedicated to their moral narrative about freedom being sacred, and that restricting someone's control of their own body is always wrong.

From a moral standpoint, they are both right. These are both great virtues, and I am glad to live in a time where people care about such important things.

From a policy standpoint, there is no contradiction in their desires. The same kind of policy that would achieve the red team's goals would also achieve the blue team's goals.

But, they refuse to come to agreement on any policy. They endlessly debate the abstract differences in their moral philosophy, and because of this, third party interests are able to manipulate every other aspect of laws being passed.
Out of rich developed nations, American women are the most likely to end up in that desperate situation, where they would even consider getting an abortion.

Americans are so dedicated to getting their own moral narrative written onto the decisions being made. It is even more important to them than the moral narrative itself.
The moral narrative has just become a flag for their team, to symbolize their control. Like a gangster spray-painting a wall to mark his gang's territory.
They are willing to sacrifice the women and fetuses they claim to care about, just to mark their territory.

The desperate women who are considering abortions, and the infants being aborted, they are the innocents caught in the cross fire of this war of moral narratives.

Blue Hypocrisy
=======

If the blue team compromised on the moral narrative aspect of the policy, and allowed for abortion to be called "murder", then we could come up with a policy that protects women and gives them the freedom to get abortions when they need it.
Soldiers can murder. Juries in a court of law can order a death penalty. So we could also let doctors murder fetuses, in the right circumstances.
Compromising on the moral narrative of the law would allow them to actually achieve the moral virtues they claim to desire.
The fact that they wont is hypocrisy.

Red Hypocrisy
=======

If the red team compromised on the moral narrative aspect of the policy, and allowed for abortion to be called "women controlling their own bodies", then we could come up with a policy that minimizes the incidence of abortion, so as few people are murdered as possible.
Even if abortion is called "women controlling their own bodies", it is still possible for us to have a policy that minimizes the number of abortions.
Compromising on the moral narrative of the law would allow them to actually achieve the moral virtues they claim to desire.
The fact that they wont is hypocrisy.


Futarchy Save Us
========

Futarchy show us the consequences of our decisions.
So that we can know which decisions are inconsequential aesthetic details.
That way, we wont waste time in these toxic debates.
