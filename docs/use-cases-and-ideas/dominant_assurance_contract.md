Tragedy of the commons is when people pay less than how much the public good would benefit them.

For example, lets say Bob owns a store that will be $10,000 more valuable if a bridge gets built.
There are 4 possibilities:
1) Bob doesn't contribute to the bridge, and the bridge is built. Bob is $10,000 richer.
2) Bob doesn't contribute to the bridge, and the bridge is not built. Bob is $0 richer.
3) Bob contributes $9000 and the bridge is built. Bob is $1000 richer.
4) Bob contributes $9000 and the bridge is not built. Bob gets his money back plus interest, he is $1000 richer.
5) Bob contributes $5000 and the bridge is built. Bob is $5000 richer.
6) Bob contributes $5000 and the bridge is not built. Bob gets his money back plus interest, he is $500 richer

Option 1 is the most profitable, but it is risky because option 2 might happen.
If Bob donates $9000, then he knows he will get $1000 profit either way. His risk is completely gone.
I expect most people to do a mixed strategy that only partially gets rid of their risk, like paying only $5000.
