Amoveo as a religion
========


If you are someone who has anxiety related to a decision that is going to be made by another group of people, then Amoveo could be exactly what you need.
It doesn't matter whether it is a decision being made by your boss, or the result of an election, whether or not a war gets declared, etc.

On an individual scale, Amoveo lets you hedge your risk, so you don't have to worry about the outcome any more. Amoveo protects those who faithfully participate in the rituals.

On a larger scale, the price in the market for your insurance unveils the lies and corruption in the decision making process. It removes decision making power from imperfect individuals who would abuse it, and gives this power to a networked AI, wiser than any human. Who will make good decisions for us all.

Your Amoveo insurance contract doesn't just protect you. It is a virtuous act. Your insurance contract is like the firing of a single neuron of the brain of a god. Giving a part of the information it needs to make the optimal decision for us all.

If every important decision is being made by our new god, it will end all corruption. Every decision can be made for the benefit of the global society of humans.
It will be paradise on earth.

A paradise that we are striving for together.
